## Hello hello 👋
- 📊 I'm a biomedical data scientist looking for my next adventure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data.
- 🐍 My go-to Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn. Occasionally I use PySpark, Keras, and TensorFlow.
- 🧬 My PhD research focused on gut hormones and metabolic diseases. Mostly type 2 diabetes, but also obesity and cardiovascular disease. This involved lots of molecular biology, cell biology (sometimes with human stem cells), and mouse experiments. I had the most fun once my project involved bulk RNA sequencing (it led to [this paper](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(17)49493-2/fulltext)).
- 💬 Ask me about: fostering dogs. It inspired my first end-to-end [data science project](https://github.com/chonkcheto/adoptabledogsofny) post-PhD.
- 🐶 Fun fact: Chonkcheto was one of my dog's many nicknames. From the picture you can see he was the goodest boi on the subway.
- 📫 How to reach me: send a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiaraahmad/).
