## Hello hello 👋
- 📊 I'm a data scientist looking for my next adventure.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my data engineering skills.
- 🧬 I did my PhD research on gut hormones and metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease).
- 🐍 My go-to Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn. Occasionally I use PySpark, Keras, and TensorFlow.
- 🐶 Ask me about: fostering dogs. It inspired my first end-to-end data science project post-PhD.
- 📫 How to reach me: send a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiaraahmad/).
- ⛸️ Fun fact: I started figure skating in my second year of grad school. I'm perpertually working on my spins.
- 🐶 Another fun fact: Chonkcheto was one of my dog's many nicknames. He also went by Gordito and Monsieur Chonkington. From the picture you can see he was the goodest boi on the subway.
